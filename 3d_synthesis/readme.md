# 3D Synthesis Gaussian Splatting + Hands & Ring tracking and detection (Mediapipe and YOLO) 

---

## Overview

3D Modeling Approach:
Construct a 3D model (or rig) of Anna or her hand to seamlessly fit any jewelry piece.
This approach can simplify how jewelry items are matched and visualized, providing flexibility in adjusting designs.
