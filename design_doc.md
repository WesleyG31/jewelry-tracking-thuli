# Hands & Ring tracking and detection – Design Document

## Overview

The challenge was to create a system that can detect rings on moving hands in real-time — knowing the problem is open-ended and ambiguous by design. My goal was to explore a single, critical component (ring tracking) deeply and practically: a pipeline that detects rings worn on fingers using real video input and need to have low latency (mobile-first jewelry marketplace)

Rather than aiming for a perfect end product, I prefered to build an MVP focused on robust and testable solution , learning from every iteration, and documenting the rationale behind each decision.

## Assumptions & Scope

### What I included:
- Hand tracking using MediaPipe
- ROI extraction based on MCP–PIP alignment
- YOLOv8n-based ring detection
- Real-time detection via webcam
- Streamlit app for easy testing and sharing

### What I excluded (due to time constraints):
- Earrings, clothing, full-body tracking

### Assumptions:
- Rings are most commonly worn on index, middle, and ring fingers
- Input could be from a standard webcam, a phone video, external cam.
- Performance must be real-time (low latency), and work under normal lighting

### Pipeline

1. Hand Tracking – hand_tracker.py

    Uses MediaPipe’s 21 landmarks per hand

    Lightweight and very accurate for fingers

2. ROI Extraction – region_finger.py

    Computes the midpoint between MCP and PIP joints

    Uses vector math to build a rectangle aligned with finger direction

    Applies cv2.getPerspectiveTransform() to obtain clean ROIs

3. (First design) Ring Detection by colors – ring_detector_colors.py

    Based on colors (Heuristic Detection)

    Works on the small area and has very low latency

4. (Main design) Ring Detection by YOLO – ring_detector_yolo.py

    Loads a YOLOv8n model trained specifically on ring data

    Works on the small aligned ROI (fast and focused)

    Uses confidence threshold = 0.55 for balance

5. Interfaces

    main_ring_detector_yolo.py: OpenCV-based real-time detection

    app.py: Streamlit web app to test easily in browser

    | Mediapipe Hands      | Precise finger/hand detection, Ideal for mobile first                                      |
    | MCP–PIP based ROI    | Aligns with where rings are worn, better than fixed box                                    |
    | Perspective warping  | Keeps ROI aligned despite hand rotation, improves detection                                |
    | Heuristic Detection  | It depends a lot on the color of the rings, it cannot be a single model for several rings. |
    | Custom ring model    | Pretrained YOLOs don’t detect rings — I trained my own                                     |

## Iterations & Learnings

Throughout the project, I explored several approaches, learned from failures, and refined the system through multiple iterations. Here's a breakdown of my process:

### 🔹 Hands Tracking 

**Approach:**  

I began with a simple and classic approach using OpenCV:
- I used Mediapipe solutions hands because we needed to track the hands too.
- Fast way to track hand points.

**Why I tried this:**  

This method is fast and doesn’t require training data, just read how to use the landmarks.

**Result:**  
- Worked really well, it didn't take too long

**Learning:**

### 🔹 Static Rectangular ROI per Finger

**Approach:**  
I used MediaPipe landmarks to extract a box between MCP and PIP joints of the finger (the typical ring area).  
The ROI was horizontal and fixed in shape.

**Why I tried this:**  
I assumed the region between MCP and PIP would cover most rings, and I wanted a simple pipeline to pass consistent ROIs into detection.

**Result:**  
- Boxes didn’t follow finger rotation.
- When the hand tilted, ROIs missed the actual ring.
- Detections were inconsistent and unreliable.

**Learning:**  
A box without considering finger orientation causes misalignment, especially in motion. ROI must rotate with the finger to stay accurate.

### 🔹 Rotated ROI using getRotationMatrix2D - warpAffine

**Approach:**  
I computed the angle between MCP and PIP to rotate the ROI with `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D` and `warpAffine`.

**Why I tried this:**  
I wanted the ROI to follow the finger's angle for better localization and to improve detection robustness.

**Result:**  
- I didn't understand well the maths.
- The region was not positioned well (like the hand down in front of the camera) the ROI went to the MCP and did not fit where the ring is used.

**Learning:**  
Needed something more precise.
Improve the maths, specially the orientation for vectors and how to draw the rectangle

![vectors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf6fb72d-815c-4ec9-bfc4-0b0084388ceb)

Then I needed to understand how to get the points of the rectangle, what calculations did I have to make?
Everything had to be based on the direction of the vector.

Top-Left = cx - lx - wx, cy - ly - wy

Top-Right = cx - lx + wx, cy - ly + wy

Bottom-Right = cx + lx + wx, cy + ly + wy

Bottom-Left = cx + lx - wx, cy + ly - wy


![points_box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91bb7299-5746-45ec-b6d2-24d1d684ad8b)

Then I realized I can't send this image to the model because it is not a good perspective so that's why I use warpPerspective

![perspectiva del rectangulo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f8c7d3-f940-45c5-a5d8-9261da884ec6)

Then to draw the box in a good perspective I needed to understand how to draw the rectangle based on point just joining the points.

### 🔹 Perspective-Corrected ROI using `warpPerspective`

**Approach:**  
I created a full rectangle aligned with the finger direction using vector math, and extracted a perspective-corrected region with `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`.

**Why I tried this:**  
To ensure the ROI remains aligned regardless of hand orientation or rotation — keeping it consistent for any detection model.

**Result:**  
- Great improvement in ring localization.
- ROIs were perfectly aligned to fingers.
- Compatible with both heuristics and YOLO input.

**Learning:**  
This was the turning point. Properly aligned ROIs significantly improve consistency and allow more generalizable detection logic.

### 🔹 Heuristic Detection (Colors)

**Approach:**  
I began with a simple and classic approach using OpenCV:
- Converted finger regions to HSV.
- Used color thresholds for black and blue.

**Why I tried this:**  
This method is fast and doesn’t require training data and thought it would be good for a quick prototype.

**Result:**  
- Worked only under ideal lighting.
- Many false negatives due to combinations of colors

**Learning:**  
Heuristics are limited when dealing with lighting, and style diversity. I needed a learned model.

### 🔹 YOLOv8n Model Integration

**Approach:**  
I trained a custom YOLOv8n model using annotated ring images via Roboflow.

**Why I tried this:**  
Heuristics and color filters failed in 50% cases. YOLO allows shape, context, and general appearance to be learned from data.

**Result:**  
- Used Yolo v8 NANO, small model for mobile - first.
- Very strong performance on various hand poses and lighting.
- Real-time.
- Low false positives, good generalization.
- I only captured 500 images with and without rings.
- I used Roboflow to label and augmentation so I got like 1300 images to train the model

**Learning:**  
A trained detector is essential for visual tasks involving variable appearance and movement. But it still needs **clean, well-aligned inputs**, which I had prepared in earlier steps.

Dataset is really important, also labeling takes so much time.

### 🔹 Streamlit Integration

**Approach:**  
I created a Streamlit app (`app.py`) so the system can be tested easily from the browser.

**Why I tried this:**  
To make the system demo-friendly and user-accessible — ideal for a startup or team looking to share results quickly.

**Result:**  
- Easy testing.
- Clear visual feedback.

**Learning:**  
Presentation matters — making your tools usable for others adds serious value to any system.

---

### 🎯 General Learnings

- **Iterative development matters.** Every step taught me something valuable.
- **Don’t over-engineer too early.** My best results came when I simplified, then rebuilt based on feedback.
- **Precision in ROI design is crucial.** Especially in mobile-first applications with gesture input.
- **Combining ML with geometric reasoning** (YOLO + landmark-based ROIs) provides robust, scalable results.



## Failure Cases & Limitations / Technical Trade-offs

- Accuracy depends on the objective. In this case is better if we can detect the rings despite the hand is far from the camera.
- Detection needs to be really fast, that's why I just analyze a region of the finger.
- Need more dataset to improve detection but mostly types of rings.

---

## Future Improvements

### Data Collection

- Focus on collecting more types of rings and perspectives where the model will be use.
- Add detection for earrings and necklaces.
- Improve robustness with larger datasets.

### Use Mediapipe body

- Track the full body with a fast model.

### 3D Modelling

- Integrate with 3D modeling for product visualization.

### Define on which platform it will be launched

- Build a full mobile-first UI.
- Used a smaller o bigger model depends on the platform.

## Alignment with Thuli Studios Vision

Thuli Studios’ mission to build AI-native, India-first products directly inspired my approach.

Designed for diverse hand tones and dynamic gestures.

Real-time performance makes it ideal for DYLA-style marketplaces.

Can work in influencer video previews, mirror-based try-ons (when the model detected the rings in my screen).

Easily extendable to other jewelry forms.

## Summary

I approached this challenge as a chance to show:

That I can think clearly and structure a system

That I can balance creativity with pragmatism

That I enjoy building and iterating under constraints

I’m proud of what I built — not because it’s perfect, but because it’s practical, modular, and real.

Thanks for this opportunity. I hope to continue building with you.
